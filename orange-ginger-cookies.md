| ingredient                        | amount   | notes |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| unsalted butter, room remperature | 0.5 cups |       |
| orange zest                       | 1 tsp    |       |

1. In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter and 1 cup sugar on medium until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg, molasses and ginger.
3. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add flour mixture, mixing until just incorporated (dough will be soft). Cover and refrigerate until firm enough to handle, about 1 hour.
4. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Place remaining 1⁄2 cup sugar in small bowl. Working with 1 sheet at a time and keeping dough covered, roll 1⁄2 teaspoon dough into a ball and then roll in sugar to coat. Place balls 1 inch apart on prepared sheet. Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. Heat oven to 350°F. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool on sheets 2 minutes, then slide paper with cookies onto wire rack to cool completely.
6. Make Orange Buttercream: Using an electric mixer, beat butter on medium speed until creamy, 2 minutes; beat in orange zest. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add confectioners’ sugar (sifted); beat in heavy cream.
7. Once cool, sandwich cookies with small amount of Orange Buttercream.
