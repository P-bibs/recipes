## Raspberry Ganache (NYTimes)

| weight | ingredient      | volume  |
| ------ | --------------- | ------- |
| 115g   | white chocolate |         |
| 4g     | vanilla extract | 1 tsp   |
| pinch  | salt            |         |
| 57g    | raspberry       | 1/3 cup |
| 60g    | heavy cream     | 1/4 cup |

In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the white chocolate, vanilla and salt. Place the fresh raspberries in a medium-mesh sieve and, working over a small saucepan, use a flexible spatula to mash the berries and press the pulp through the sieve into the saucepan until all thatâ€™s left is the seeds. (Make sure to scrape the bottom of the sieve to extract all the pulp.) Add the cream to the saucepan and stir to combine, then bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Set the saucepan aside to cool for about a minute, then pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and let it sit for several minutes. Whisk gently, starting in the center and working your way outward, until smooth. Transfer the ganache to the refrigerator and chill, stirring occasionally, until thick and spreadable, at least 45 minutes. Scrape the ganache into a piping bag fitted with a medium round pastry tip and twist the bag to close. Keep refrigerated while you bake the shells.
